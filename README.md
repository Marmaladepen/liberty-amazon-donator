# Liberty Amazon Donator (Chrome Extension)

## Summary

Chrome extension that automatically applies Amazon Affiliate Tracking Id of Liberty-promoting organizations to Amazon webpages you visit.

## Purpose
*Liberty Amazon Donator* is a Chrome browser extension that makes it easy to direct a portion of the money you spend on Amazon to your favorite Liberty organization at no cost to you!
Once the extension is installed, it will add an Amazon Associate Id tag to the Amazon links you visit and your organization will receive a kickback for every purchase you make.

Works on Amazon.com, .ca, .co.uk, .fr, .de, .cn, .co.jp and .it.   
   
## Usage

By default, every 24 hours the extension picks a random organization to donate to (since the
Amazon cookie is active for 24 hours). For the next 24 hours, Amazon assigns a share of any purchases you make to this organization
(between [1% to 10%](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/help/operating/advertisingfees) capped to $10-$25 maximum depending).

You can add or remove an organization as well as update its affiliate codes per country.

If you'd prefer to give a particular organization more (or less) chances of a getting a share of your
purchases, then you can increase (or decrease) its assigned probability to any value between 0% (will never be picked) and
100% (will always be picked).
